# The future...

- Improving communication and collaboration between design and development.

- Have a defined workflow and better overview of where the weak point are in design and development processes.
  
- Use Storybook more extensively, hopefully in the future this will be a better source-of-truth than initial/ongoing designs in figma.

- Automate some form of design-token document with GitHub Actions, design tokens, or Specify for token synchronization.
