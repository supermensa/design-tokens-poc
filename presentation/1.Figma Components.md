# Figma Components

**Initial question:** Using some variant of design tokens, can we create wireframes for standard components that will save both design and development time, so that we can use more time on custom components and user experience?

In figma:

- How to use tokens (variables) extensively in Figma  - e.g. making reusable and configurable components.

- **Working outside traditional wireframes:**
  - Start with simple designs and iterate, enriching the content as you go
  - Treat the document as a living entity, rather than moving from wireframe → design sketches → final design
  
- **Learnings: Component adjustments:**
  - Create more flexible components that fits how designers work
  - Insights on systematizing and building design systems in Figma
