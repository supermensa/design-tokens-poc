# Key takeaways

A shift to using design tokens is not just a technical setup, it involves different people and ways of working.

- understand people are different (ways of working, understanding, experience etc.)
  
- understand/establish a shared vocabulary (not all common expressions are universally understood.)
  
- work small, break things down (focus on one thing/problem at a time)
  
- work simple (only use features if you need them)
  
- iterations (talk, play, collaborate)

- design tokens as an artefact that can visualise or point to parts and the inherit problems and solutions of what we're working on together.

Design tokens are still evolving, so maybe the idea of one single source of truth in web development is still a wild ambition. We should focus more on forming some conversation-spaces where designers along with developers and other stakeholders can work together and find common understanding.

If design tokens raises new questions, you probably onto something! :-D
