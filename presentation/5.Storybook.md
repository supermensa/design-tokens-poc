# Storybook

At the moment we are building our standard components in storybook, which hopefully will bring more interesting things to the table in the process of collaboration between design < > development.

- Figma components could link directly to storybook components
  
- Better way of integrating user stories directly in the component
  
- Testing figma components inside Storybook
  
- Possible integrations back to Figma, for example importing existing Storybook components into Figma via plugin.
