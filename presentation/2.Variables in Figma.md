# Variables in Figma

You can find the variables pane in Figma named "Local variables in the right menu-bar"

- Establish a standard (your own) naming convention for variables/ design tokens.

- Right now you have to use a figma plugin to export variables from Figma, here we use the free  [variables2json plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1253571037276959291).
  
- Assets caveats: variables definitions are transferred _in_ components, but variables are not. This means that an assets library will be locked into a design, so if you need to edit the components used, it is better to use a duplicate file than an assets library. This will allow designers to edit the atomic components themselves to fit the design on a given project.
