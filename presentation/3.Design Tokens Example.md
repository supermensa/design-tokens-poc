# Design Tokens Example
Towards a a single point of truth for design? (Good luck ;-)) 

This isn't a complete way of using design-tokens as that document would be a json file that lives outside of both figma and your frontend project.

Proof of concept: (See html files for example)

Things to take notice of:

- Exporting variables to JSON and converting them to CSS variables via a small custom node script
  
- Build a css file that uses the css variables to define the standard components. Nothing will be 1:1 here, but if set up right, updating variables in figma and exporting them to json will continue to work with the html version.
  
- A system of how to define other project settings in figma could be established by naming conventions, like prefixing variables with 'assets-', 'script-' or other, where our custom converter could build output script- variables to a separate json files and 'css-' to a css variables file.
